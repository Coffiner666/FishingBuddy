Fishing Buddy keeps track of the fish you catch and helps manage your fishing gear.

## Features

- Double-click fishing
- Supports the WoW "fish without a pole" feature
- Bring out your fishing pets! Drink heavily!
- "Fish Watcher" shows fish caught in the current session and in this location before
- Displays current skill level and time spent fishing
- Choose a fishing outfit and swap to it easily
- Automatically adds a lure to your fishing pole
- Tracks "cycle fish" (for example, Nightfin Snapper)

## Example Commands

- `/fishingbuddy` or `/fb` toggles the Fishing Buddy window
- `/fb help` prints the list of Fishing Buddy commands
- `/fb switch` wears your chosen fishing outfit or switches back

## Known Issues

- "Fast Loot" addons can interfere with fish counting because the loot disappears before it can be recorded.

## Fun Extras

- Displays fishing bonus and "style points" based on Draznar's Fishing FAQ:
